# EduRansW-Simulation

EduRansW is an innovative educational tool aimed at providing a practical learning experience in understanding, decrypting, and combating ransomware threats. Developed by WebSec B.V., it simulates real-world ransomware behavior, allowing users to engage in reverse engineering and decryption activities without any risk to personal data or systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10 or newer
- C++ Reds (Only if it doesnt work, see readme.txt)

### Installation
1. Visit [https://websec.nl/downloads](https://websec.nl/downloads) to download the latest version of EduRansW.
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your preferred location.
3. Run `RansWSimulator.exe` to start the simulation.

## How It Works

EduRansW creates a secure, simulated environment where a directory named "CryptPath" is automatically generated. This directory acts as the target for the simulated ransomware attack, where files are encrypted. The challenge for users is to reverse-engineer the application, decrypt the encrypted files, and understand the mechanisms of ransomware attacks.

## Features

- Simulated ransomware encryption within a controlled environment
- No risk to actual user data or system integrity
- Enhances understanding of ransomware operation and decryption techniques

## Disclaimer

EduRansW is developed strictly for educational purposes. Users must agree to use this tool responsibly and acknowledge its intent to promote cybersecurity education. WebSec B.V. assumes no liability for misuse of this software or any damages resulting from its use.
